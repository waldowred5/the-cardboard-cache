# T2A2 - Marketplace: The Cardboard Cache

### **R7 - The Problem:**

For many members in the board game community, a large number of board games in every collection end up sitting on the shelf collecting dust. Due to high frequency of new game releases, board game enthusiasts tend to pick up more games than they can reasonably get to the tabletop. Additionally, a lot of games have an immense set of rules to learn, which provides a barrier to entry for new players and gaming groups. Consequently, more complex games or games that a group hasn't already learned the rules for rarely end up seeing any play time.

There is already a very active community of board game enthusiasts, many of which use existing platforms to buy and sell second hand board games. While it is possible to sell board games on existing platforms, there are a number of drawbacks to using them:
- eBay: Great general platform for buying and selling, but not very well tailored to board game sales, and includes transaction fees for sellers
- Facebook Marketplace: No transaction fees, but even less suitable for board game sales than eBay
- Geek Market (an existing board game marketplace, provided by 'Board Game Geeks'): Tailored for board game sales, but includes transaction fees for sellers

In addition to these platform specific issues, the second hand board game market is stifled by expensive shipping costs, due to the size and weight of most games, making sales not worthwhile for sellers and too expensive for buyers.

### **R8 - Why does it need solving?**

What if there was a way to buy, sell or swap board games, for free, with other board game enthusiasts without having to pay any additional shipping?

**This would allow all of the abandoned board games to finally get back to the tabletop, as originally intended by their creators.**

A key strategy for this approach would be to focus on board game trades between users, to encourage board game enthusiasts to try many different games they would otherwise not be able to afford (or fit in their game shelves).
